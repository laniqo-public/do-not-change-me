# Do not change me - dataset listing entities that should not be modified in the translation process.


## What is this?

This repository contains the dataset used in the paper: 

Do Not Change Me: On Transferring Entities Without Modification in Neural Machine Translation -- a Multilingual Perspective (accepted at MTSummit 2025)

## And how about some more details?

In this work, we investigate how modern machine translation systems handle non-translatable entities â€” like emails, phone numbers, URLs, or emojis â€” and whether they preserve them correctly across languages. Surprisingly, even state-of-the-art systems often struggle!

ðŸ“Š We created and released a synthetic multilingual dataset (36,000 sentences, 9 entity types, 4 languages) and benchmarked 8 translation models, including Google Translate â€” with insightful results!
